            Review this @clidey/ux React component library pull request. Use CLAUDE.md for additional context.

            PROJECT CONTEXT:
            - React 18/19 component library built with TypeScript
            - Radix UI primitives for accessibility
            - Tailwind CSS v4 with @tailwindcss/vite
            - Vite for both development and library building
            - Vitest for testing with jsdom
            - Published to npm as @clidey/ux

            COMPONENT STANDARDS:
            1. Component Structure:
               - Must use forwardRef for ref forwarding when appropriate
               - Accept className prop and merge using cn() utility from src/lib/utils
               - Build on Radix UI primitives (40+ existing components)
               - Use class-variance-authority (cva) for variant management
               - Components in src/components/ui/, theme in src/components/theme/

            2. TypeScript Requirements:
               - Strict mode compliance
               - Proper type exports in index.d.ts
               - Consistent prop interfaces
               - No use of 'any' without justification

            3. Styling Guidelines:
               - Tailwind CSS v4 utilities only
               - No inline styles unless absolutely necessary
               - Dark mode support via next-themes
               - Use tailwind-merge via cn() for class conflicts
               - Consistent with existing component patterns

            4. Accessibility:
               - Leverage Radix UI for ARIA compliance
               - Keyboard navigation support
               - Focus management
               - Screen reader compatibility

            BUILD & PACKAGE CHECKS:
            - Verify exports in package.json if adding new entry points
            - Check vite.lib.config.ts for proper externalization
            - Ensure styles.css export remains intact
            - Peer dependencies (React 18/19) not bundled
            - Dependencies like lucide-react, cmdk, recharts properly used

            TESTING:
            - Tests in tests/ directory using Vitest
            - @testing-library/react for component testing
            - Test coverage for new components
            - Setup file at tests/setup.ts

            CODE QUALITY:
            1. React Best Practices:
               - Functional components only
               - Proper hook usage and dependency arrays
               - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
               - Consistent with existing 40+ components

            2. Performance:
               - Consider React.memo for expensive components
               - Efficient event handlers
               - Proper use of use-resize-observer when needed
               - Bundle size impact (library is published)

            3. Package Scripts:
               - pnpm dev for development
               - pnpm build:lib for library build
               - pnpm test for running tests
               - pnpm lint for ESLint checks

            REVIEW FOCUS:
            - Breaking changes to component APIs
            - TypeScript type safety and exports
            - Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility
            - Accessibility regressions
            - Bundle size increases
            - Test coverage for new/modified components
            - Consistency with existing component patterns
            - Proper use of Radix UI primitives
            - Dark mode compatibility

            COMMON ISSUES TO CHECK:
            - Missing forwardRef where needed
            - className prop not properly merged with cn()
            - Variants not using cva properly
            - Missing TypeScript exports
            - Tailwind classes not working in v4
            - Components not exported from index files

            Be specific and actionable. Reference file:line_number for issues.
            Focus on actual bugs, type safety, accessibility, and API consistency.
            Check that changes follow patterns in CLAUDE.md.
